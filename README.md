# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge
about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient
has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
2. Create a dashboard in tableau by choosing appropriate chart types and metrics useful for the business.
The dashboard must entail the following:
 a. Pie chart to describe the diabetic or non-diabetic population
 b. Scatter charts between relevant variables to analyze the relationships
 c. Histogram or frequency charts to analyze the distribution of the data
 d. Heatmap of correlation analysis among the relevant variables
 e. Create bins of these age values: 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, etc. Analyze different
variables for these age brackets using a bubble chart.
